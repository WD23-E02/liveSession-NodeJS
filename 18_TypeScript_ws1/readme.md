## WTF is TypeScript (TS)

- TS is a programming language
- TS is mainly maintained and developed by Microsoft

  - Just like GitHub
  - Just like VSCode

- The TS file extension is `.ts` (or if we are in react we can use .tsx)
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript

  - TS adds additional syntax to JavaScript
  - TS = JavaScript + other stuff (Types, basically)
  - This means you can write normal JavaScript in a `.ts` file and it will work
  - So your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code!

- TS code is compiled to JavaScript by basically just deleting all of the "other stuff"!
- In general, writing TS means writing significantly more code than JS
  - But many, many errors are caught very quickly due to type safety
